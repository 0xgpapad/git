The *.sample hook scripts installed in this repository have been
copied from Git source code by "git init".  Because Git itself as a
whole is licensed under the GPL-2.0 license [*1*], some people have
raised concerns if these scripts somehow contaminate the contents
developed by the end users and stored in their repository.

While we, Git developers, are not your lawyers, we believe the
presence of these sample hook scripts in your repository does not
constitute "distribution" that makes the contents tracked in your
repository governed also under the same license as ours, but it would
be a good idea to clarify that

 * We do not intend to spread the license of Git to your contents by
   copying the sample hook scripts.

 * These sample hook scripts may be under licenses other than GPL-2.0.

The list below describes under which open-source license each sample
hook script is licensed.

NEEDSWORK:

Below are draft entries that do show correct commit object names that
matter to, or contributors who write, the surviving contents of the
file, but these people haven't been asked to do anything yet (hence
they haven't responded yet, of course), so they do not show what the
licensing status of these files will be at the end of this exercise
yet.

What I am hoping to achieve is to replace the text under each bullet
point to document who the authors/copyright holders are of the file,
and under what license the copy given to each end-user repository is
usable by the end-user.  It would be more useful if the license chosen
(which can be different per file) is more lenient than strict.
